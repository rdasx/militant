Personal Vaporizer mod. Provides boost circuitry to run higher voltage as well as a built in USB charger. Will Probably be abandoned.

Files with "simple" in the name represent a subproject for a smaller, simpler, board that does away with the boost circuitry. Includes "in-situ" charging and a power mosfet for long switch life.
